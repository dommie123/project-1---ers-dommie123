# Expense Reimbursement System (ERS)
An Employee Reimbursement System used to create, track, and update tickets for employee reimbursement. The employees can log in to the system or register for a new account. Then, they can view past tickets and create new tickets. The Financial Managers can also log in and/or register as well as approve or reject reimbursement tickets and view a catalog of every ticket recorded in the database.
